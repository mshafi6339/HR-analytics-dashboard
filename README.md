## Attrition Trends

* **Overall Attrition:** We're seeing a **16% overall attrition rate**, which is a significant figure requiring attention.
* **Departmental Impact:** The **Sales department accounts for the largest share of attrition (56.12%)**, followed by R&D (38.82%). HR has a much lower attrition rate. This suggests specific issues within Sales and R&D that need investigation.
